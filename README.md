# Cuvette Assignment
During the Cuvette assignment evaluation, I meticulously crafted a responsive job-posting website, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices. Employing a combination of HTML, CSS,Bootstrap,Express,React and Nodejs, the site offers fluid and captivating animations integrated seamlessly into it. Employing the acclaimed Mobile First methodology, I meticulously developed the interface, guaranteeing flawless responsiveness on mobile devices, subsequently extending the same impeccable design to desktop screens. Embracing the latest web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the website boasts a visually engaging user interface, delivering an immersive and pleasant browsing experience.
